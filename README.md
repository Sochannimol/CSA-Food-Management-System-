The Food Management App streamlines food tasks by allowing users to easily organize food items, search by name or location, place orders with transportation options, and track order history. Key functions include creating tables, handling user registration and login, adding food items to the database, searching for items, viewing order history, and managing current orders. To use the app, simply install the dependencies and run `Food.final.py` to get started.
